# FedoraAutoconfig
### A set of shell scripts to configure Fedora Linux to my personal preferences

---
## Features
- Has an option to download NVIDIA Drivers
- Installs RPM Fusion Repos (free and nonfree)
- Automatically configures packages
- Uses `wget` to download vscode and Google Chrome
	- Automatically installs these packages using DNF

## Notes
- Testing Status: UNTESTED
- This project requires root privileges (just do sudo ./start.sh and you will be fine)
- This is intended for personal use (but you can use it too if you want)
- You NEED to have a working and stable internet connection (for package setup)
- vscode and Google Chrome packages may be out of date, it is YOUR job to review the code and update the file
- You should use Fedora Linux for best compatibility
- **I will not take responsibility if you break your system, so please be careful!**

## Requirements
- BASH
- Git (optional)

### Thanks for reading!
